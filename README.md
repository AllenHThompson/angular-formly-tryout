# angular-formly-tryou

## Summary
A car web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS. I borrowed the code from a blog post by Ryan Chenkie. I discovered this blog post as I was researching a way to dynamically create forms with AngularJS. One of my apps is a handyman app. I want to present to the user several 'services'. I didn't want to create a separate form for each service. Formly, and this showcase app was exactly what I was looking for.
